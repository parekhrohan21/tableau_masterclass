# README: Question-Wise Explanations for West Nile Virus Mosquito Test Results Dataset

This document provides detailed explanations for analyzing the dataset `West_Nile_Virus__WNV__Mosquito_Test_Results_20240430 (1).xlsx`. The dataset contains information about mosquito testing conducted in Chicago from 2007 to 2023, including test results, species, geographical locations, and other metadata. Below are explanations for potential questions that can be derived from this dataset.

---

## **Question 1: Where are the traps with the highest positivity rates located?**

### Explanation:
- **Analysis**: To identify traps with the highest positivity rates, calculate the positivity rate for each trap as:
  \[
  \text{Positivity Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Positive Tests}}{\text{Total Number of Tests}} \times 100
  \]
  Group the data by `TRAP` and compute the positivity rate for each trap.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Traps with high positivity rates are often located in areas with higher mosquito populations or near bird habitats (e.g., O’Hare Airport, Belmont Cragin).
  - Geographical coordinates (`LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE`) can be used to map these traps and visualize their distribution.
- **Conclusion**: Traps in certain neighborhoods, such as O’Hare and Belmont Cragin, consistently show high positivity rates.

---

## **Question 2: Why do some locations have a higher positivity rate than others?**

### Explanation:
- **Analysis**: Investigate factors influencing positivity rates, such as:
  - Proximity to water bodies (breeding grounds for mosquitoes).
  - Prevalence of infected birds (reservoir hosts for WNV).
  - Urban vs. suburban environments.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Areas away from the waterline tend to have higher positivity rates because they are closer to bird habitats.
  - Infected bird populations likely contribute to higher infection rates in mosquitoes.
- **Conclusion**: Higher positivity rates are linked to environmental factors like infected bird populations and urban/suburban settings rather than proximity to water.

---

## **Question 3: How many traps are located in zip code 60626?**

### Explanation:
- **Analysis**: Filter the dataset for rows where `Zip Codes = 60626` and count the unique values in the `TRAP` column.
- **Key Observations**:
  - There are **4 traps** in zip code 60626.
  - These traps are located in various blocks, such as `51XX W 63RD PL` and `58XX N WESTERN AVE`.
