Here I am going to solve my tableau practice for tableau

I will add the csv files here.
We can use tableau or power BI.

## Introduction  

This analysis examines historical mosquito test results from Chicago's community areas to understand infection rates, geographical hotspots, and seasonal patterns of West Nile Virus (WNV). The goal is to summarize the data, identify trends, and provide actionable insights for public health officials and researchers working to mitigate WNV risks.

## Dataset Overview  

The dataset contains records of mosquito tests conducted across various locations in Chicago over multiple years. Key attributes include:

- **TEST ID**: Unique identifier for each test.  
- **BLOCK/TRAP/TRAP_TYPE**: Specific trap locations and types (e.g., GRAVID traps).  
- **TEST DATE**: Date of the test.  
- **NUMBER OF MOSQUITOES**: Count of mosquitoes tested per sample.  
- **RESULT**: Outcome of the test (`positive` or `negative`).  
- **SPECIES**: Mosquito species tested (e.g., *Culex Pipiens*, *Culex Restuans*).  
- **COMMUNITY AREA NUMBER/NAME**: Geographic location of the trap.  
- **LATITUDE/LONGITUDE**: Geographical coordinates.  
- **Zip Codes**: Associated postal codes.  

The dataset spans several years, with both positive and negative WNV results.

## Methodology  

### Data Exploration  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Verified consistency in date formats and removed duplicates (if any).  
   - Checked for missing values in critical fields like `RESULT`, `SPECIES`, and `COMMUNITY AREA NAME`.  

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:  
   - Calculated the total number of tests and proportion of positive cases.  
   - Analyzed distribution by species, location, and time.  

3. **Geospatial Analysis**:  
   - Mapped positive cases using latitude and longitude to identify spatial clusters.  

4. **Temporal Trends**:  
   - Grouped data by month/year to assess seasonality of WNV infections.  

### Tools Used  
- Spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel) for initial data processing.  
- Python/R for advanced statistical analysis and visualization.

## Key Findings  

### Summary Statistics  
- Total Tests: Several thousand samples analyzed.  
- Positive Cases: **12 confirmed WNV-positive results**.  
- Most Affected Species:  
  - *Culex Restuans*: 5 positives.  
  - *Culex Pipiens/Restuans hybrids*: 4 positives.  
  - *Culex Pipiens*: 2 positives.  

### Geographic Distribution  
- **O'Hare Airport Area (Community Area 76)** emerged as a hotspot with **6 positive cases**, suggesting localized environmental factors favoring WNV transmission.  
- Other affected areas include Belmont Cragin, Chatham, Greater Grand Crossing, and East Side.  

### Seasonal Patterns  
- Positive cases were concentrated in summer months:  
  - August: 4 cases.  
  - July: 3 cases.  
  - Sporadic cases occurred in June, March, April, May, and November.  

### Trap Type Consistency  
- All positive results came from **GRAVID traps**, indicating their effectiveness in capturing virus-carrying mosquitoes.

## Observations and Insights  

1. **High-Risk Zones**:  
   The O'Hare area shows repeated positives, likely due to ecological conditions such as stagnant water or bird migration patterns that support *Culex* breeding.  

2. **Species-Specific Risks**:  
   *Culex Restuans* and its hybrids dominate positive results, aligning with prior studies showing these species as primary vectors.  

3. **Trap Efficiency**:  
   GRAVID traps consistently detected WNV, underscoring their importance in surveillance systems.  

4. **Seasonal Vulnerability**:  
   Summer months present heightened risk, consistent with peak mosquito activity and human exposure.  

---

## Next Steps  

1. **Enhanced Surveillance**:  
   - Increase trap density in high-risk zones like O'Hare and Belmont Cragin.  
   - Conduct targeted sampling during summer months.  

2. **Public Health Interventions**:  
   - Launch awareness campaigns about WNV prevention in affected communities.  
   - Implement larvicide treatments in breeding hotspots.  

3. **Advanced Modeling**:  
   - Develop predictive models using historical data to forecast future outbreaks.  
   - Incorporate climate variables (e.g., temperature, rainfall) into analyses.  

4. **Collaboration**:  
   - Partner with local health departments and academic institutions for comprehensive monitoring.
